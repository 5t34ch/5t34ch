- 👋 Hi, I am @5t34ch
- 👀 I am interested in the specific areas of focus that Python and C++ influence and crossover in regards to LLMs and the way they talk to machines.
- 🌱 I am currently learning Python 3 and C++. I am barely starting out and am looking for any resources or direction that would point me towards what would make the most sense to learn next. I am using an LLM to write different learning plans and work through introductions to concepts of both Python and C++
- 💞️ I am looking to collaborate. 
- 📫 How to reach me - u/eldaveed6fiddy on reddit.
